Architecture Overview
Django Framework: The project is built on the Django web framework, which follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. This structure separates the data model, user interface, and control logic, making the application modular and easier to maintain.

Models: The project defines several models that represent the core entities of the e-commerce application:

**User **: Extends Django's built-in User model to include additional fields if necessary.
Product: Represents products available for sale, including fields for name, description, price, and image.
Order: Tracks user orders, including details like total price, status, and shipping information.
OrderItem: Links products to orders, specifying the quantity and price of each item.
Cart: Manages items added to the user's cart.
Wishlist: Allows users to save products they are interested in for future reference.
Review: Stores user reviews for products.
Category: Defines product categories for better organization.
Views: The views handle the business logic and interact with the models to process user requests. They render templates and return HTTP responses. The project includes views for:

Displaying products
Managing the shopping cart
Processing orders
User authentication (registration, login, logout)
Templates: The project uses Django's templating engine to render HTML pages. Templates are organized in a way that allows for easy modification and reuse. They include:

Base templates for consistent layout
Product listing and detail pages
Cart and checkout pages
Static Files: CSS, JavaScript, and image files are managed as static files, which are served to the client to enhance the user interface.

Payment Integration: The project integrates with Stripe for payment processing, allowing users to securely make payments for their orders.

URLs: The URL routing is defined in a way that maps user requests to the appropriate views, facilitating clean and user-friendly URLs.

Features Covered
User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts. The application can store user information such as first name, last name, email, and password.

Product Management: Admins can add, edit, and delete products. Users can browse products by categories, view product details, and search for specific items.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and remove items. The cart persists across sessions.

Order Processing: Users can proceed to checkout, enter shipping information, and complete their orders. The application tracks the status of each order.

Wishlist: Users can save products to a wishlist for future reference.

Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews for products, helping other customers make informed decisions.

Responsive Design: The front end is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Payment Processing: Integration with Stripe allows for secure payment processing.

Admin Interface: The Django admin interface provides a powerful way for administrators to manage users, products, orders, and other aspects of the application.

How It Works
User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in. The application uses Django's authentication system to manage user sessions.

Product Browsing: Users can view a list of products, filter by categories, and view detailed information about each product.

Adding to Cart: Users can add products to their cart, which is stored in the session. They can view their cart and make adjustments before proceeding to checkout.

Checkout Process: During checkout, users enter their shipping information and select a payment method. The application processes the payment through Stripe.

Order Confirmation: After a successful payment, users receive an order confirmation, and the order details are stored in the database.

Admin Management: Admins can log in to the admin panel to manage products, view orders, and handle user accounts.

Conclusion
The Django e-commerce project is a well-structured application that covers essential e-commerce functionalities. It leverages Django's powerful features to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. The integration with Stripe for payment processing and the use of Django's built-in user management features make it a robust solution for building an online store.
